# 🍅 TomatoFocus — A Pomofocus.io Clone

TomatoFocus is a simple Pomodoro timer web app inspired by [pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io).  
I built this project to practice and understand **HTML**, **CSS**, and especially **asynchronous JavaScript** through the use of `setInterval()` and DOM manipulation.

## 🚀 Features

## 🛠️ To Do / Improvement Ideas

- [ ] Responsive design for mobile (currently desktop only)
- [ ] Add a **delete** feature for task list items
- [ ] Count how many Pomodoro sessions have been completed
- [ ] Include detailed, trusted information about the **Pomodoro Technique**
